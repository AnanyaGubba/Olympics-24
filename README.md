# 🏅 Olympics 2024 Data Analysis
# 📌 1. Project Description
This project performs a comprehensive data analysis on the Olympics 2024 athletes dataset, uncovering key insights related to athlete demographics, participation trends, and event-based performance. The aim is to provide valuable visual and statistical analysis for sports analysts, fans, and organizations to understand patterns such as gender distribution, country-wise participation, event specialization, and more.

It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python with interactive dashboards using Power BI, and a summary presentation report to communicate findings clearly and effectively.

# 🛠️ 2. Tech Stack Used
- Python
  - pandas – data handling and analysis

  - numpy – numerical computation

  - matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization
 
# ✨ 3. Features
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Demographic Analysis
Age, gender, nationality, height, and weight distribution of athletes

- 🏃‍♂️ Sport & Event Participation
Count and breakdown of athletes per event, discipline, and country

- 🌍 Country-wise Analysis
Number of athletes per country and comparison across nations

- 📈 Trend Visualization
Visual insights into athlete roles, popular disciplines, and representation gaps

# ⚙️ 4. How It Works
🔁 Workflow Overview
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
Load Olympics 2024 dataset and preprocess it (remove nulls, standardize columns, handle duplicates).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use Python to generate plots and stats:

 - Gender ratios

 - Event frequency

 - Athlete height/weight distributions

3. Feature Engineering (if applicable)
Derive additional insights such as average age by discipline or country.

4. Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
Create meaningful plots to support visual storytelling.
